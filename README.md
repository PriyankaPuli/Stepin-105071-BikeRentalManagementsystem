This system is named as Bike Rental Management System. This system is designed to help the customers to take bikes or two-wheelers on rent. When we go on any trip outside the town or country, we want to be free of time so instead of going through metros and taxis we prefer to have our own vehicle for rent. The whole project is designed in 'C' language and different variables and strings have been used for the development of this project. Here firstly we need to enter user details. Then the user need to select the bike according to his needs,comforts and budget. This system is totally customised.
